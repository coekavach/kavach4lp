            operatingModes: [
{ title: "Standby Mode", content: "The Standby (SB) mode is the default state of the Kavach system when it's switched on or when the locomotive's reverser handle is in neutral. In this mode, the train cannot move, and Kavach performs standstill supervision, applying brakes if any speed is detected. The system conducts automatic self-tests and prompts the loco pilot to select train configuration. To exit Standby mode, the loco pilot must choose either Staff Responsible or Shunt mode based on operational needs. The loco pilot's responsibility is to observe the Standby mode after power-on, wait for successful self-tests, and respond to the configuration prompt on the LP-OCIP." },
{ title: "Staff Responsible (SR) Mode", content: "The Staff Responsible (SR) mode in Kavach is activated after self-tests and train configuration selection, requiring the loco pilot to confirm via the LP-OCIP. In this mode, Kavach supervises the locomotive's ceiling speed, prevents roll back and reverse movement, and guards against head-on and rear-end collisions. It also manages SOS generation and emergency stops when location data is available. The system automatically exits SR mode when conditions for Limited Supervision or Full Supervision modes are met. In SR mode, the loco pilot is responsible for train operation, with Kavach providing assistive supervision of the locomotive's ceiling speed." },
{ title: "Limited Supervision (LS) Mode", content: "In Limited Supervision (LS) mode, the Onboard Kavach system monitors loco speed, section speed, Permanent Speed Restrictions (PSR), and collision targets if track data and traffic direction are valid. It also ensures safety by supervising movement authority, turnout speed limits, and protecting against rollaways and reverse movements. The system automatically enters LS mode from Full Supervision (FS) mode when RFID tag data or station communication is incomplete, or during mission start until a stop signal is passed in the OFF condition. It exits LS mode and returns to FS mode when complete train and track data are available, or transitions to SR mode if both tag data and communication are lost. The loco pilot must acknowledge LP-OCIP messages to avoid automatic braking during transitions between modes." },
{ title: "Full Supervision (FS) Mode", content: "Full Supervision (FS) mode activates automatically when the Onboard Kavach receives complete communication from the station and consecutive RFID tag data, and the train passes a stop signal in OFF condition at mission start. In FS mode, Kavach supervises movement authority, turnout speeds, performs train length measurement, and adheres to loco-specific SoS from the linked station. It also displays crucial information such as train speed, permitted speed, target distance, and target speed on the LP-OCIP, and takes full responsibility for speed supervision. The system exits FS mode automatically to Limited Supervision (LS) if required data or communication is lost, to Trip mode if a signal is crossed in ON condition, or when the loco pilot manually selects Override, Shunt, or Reverse modes. The loco pilot must ensure control of the train within the permitted speed limits to avoid unintended braking by Kavach." },
{ title: "Override Mode", content: "Override (OV) mode is manually selected by the loco pilot through the LP-OCIP soft keys when there is a valid reason to bypass a signal in the ON condition, typically when the Movement Authority (MA) is less than 200 meters and the train is stationary. In this mode, Kavach displays the train speed and monitors movements against a ceiling override speed of 15 km/h, transitioning to Full Supervision (FS) mode if MA is extended or after an override timeout (240 seconds) with known section speed and traffic direction. It also obeys SoS from stationary TCAS and keeps radio transmission active within Kavach's area. The loco pilot must verify the track ahead for occupancy while in this mode and ensure proper authority is obtained to pass the signal at Danger. The system automatically exits OV mode to Onsite Mode (OS) when the train crosses the signal at ON." },
{ title: "On-sight Mode", content: "On-sight (OS) mode automatically activates when the Override (OV) mode is selected and the signal is crossed at ON. In OS mode, the Onboard Kavach allows the train to enter sections that may be occupied by other trains and supervises movements against a ceiling speed of 15 km/h. It also adheres to SOS from stationary TCAS. The system exits OS mode when the train passes specific signals, such as Last Stop Signals, Gate Signals, IB Home signals, or Auto signals, by the required distances (200m or 250m) or after crossing the next signal at an OFF aspect. The loco pilot must carefully check track occupancy as the track may be occupied while in this mode." },
{ title: "Trip Mode", content: "Trip (TR) mode activates when the Onboard Kavach is in Full Supervision or Limited Supervision mode and the train passes a stop signal at ON or the End of Authority plus 30 meters. This mode triggers the continuous application of emergency brakes to halt the train and performs standstill supervision while sending SOS signals until the trip is acknowledged. It can occur due to improper operation by the loco pilot, malfunctioning of Kavach, or signal issues with inadequate braking distance. The loco pilot must acknowledge the trip by pressing P_TRIP followed by CNFM on the LP-OCIP to release the emergency brakes. In case of Kavach malfunction, the loco pilot must isolate the system and only return it to service once it is confirmed safe." },
{ title: "Post Trip Mode", content: "Post-Trip (PT) mode is entered automatically after a train halts due to emergency braking in Trip Mode when the loco pilot selects it by pressing P_TRIP followed by CNFM on the LP-OCIP, which releases the emergency brake. In this mode, the Onboard Kavach supervises the train against a ceiling speed of 15 km/h. It exits PT mode automatically when valid Movement Authority (MA), section speed, and traffic direction are known, and the train either crosses a stop signal at OFF or travels a predefined distance of 250 meters. The loco pilot must select PT mode and confirm with CNFM to release the emergency brake and continue at the reduced speed." },
{ title: "Non Leading Mode", content: "Non-Leading (NL) mode is manually selected by the loco pilot via a rotary switch on the LP-OCIP when the train or loco is at a standstill. This mode is used for a slave engine, either electrically coupled or not coupled to the leading engine, and it disables active supervision by the Onboard Kavach while allowing periodic transmission of its status to the Kavach network. The loco pilot must change the rotary switch to Leading mode to exit NL mode. This mode should not be used in a single loco/train formation, as the Kavach will not provide train supervision or protection, placing the full responsibility for safety on the loco pilot." },
{ title: "Reverse Mode", content: "Reverse (RV) mode is manually activated by the loco pilot using the REV and CNFM soft keys on the LP-OCIP, and can only be selected when the loco is at a standstill. This mode allows the train to move in reverse while keeping the train orientation unchanged, with Kavach supervising against a ceiling speed of 15 km/h, a distance of 500 meters, and a time-out of 300 seconds. Kavach obeys SoS from stationary systems, but if the Track Identification Number (TIN) changes during reverse movement, it will generate a loco-specific SOS and apply the brakes. The system automatically exits RV mode when it detects forward movement. The loco pilot must select RV mode for pushback in emergency situations, as Kavach otherwise restricts reverse movement and ensures rollback protection." },
{ title: "Shunt Mode", content: "Shunt (SH) mode is manually selected by the loco pilot using the SHNT and CNFM soft keys on the LP-OCIP and can only be activated when the loco is at a standstill. In this mode, Kavach allows shunting operations at a restricted speed of 15 km/h and only responds to SOS signals from stationary Kavach systems. The loco pilot must manually exit SH mode by reselecting SHNT and CNFM while the train is stationary. The loco pilot is responsible for conducting shunting operations according to station working rules and relevant guidelines." },
{ title: "System Failure Mode", content: "System Failure (SF) mode automatically activates when there is a fault in the Onboard Kavach that impairs its functionality. In SF mode, Kavach continuously applies emergency brakes to halt the train. The system will recover from this mode automatically if the failure is fixable; otherwise, the loco pilot must isolate Kavach by switching to Isolation mode and closing the manual cocks. The loco pilot is responsible for isolating the system as outlined in SECTION#3(II) and operating the train under their own authority." },
{ title: "Isolation Mode", content: "Isolation (IS) mode is manually activated by the loco pilot using the Isolation switch and by closing the EM and MR cocks, if applicable. In this mode, the Onboard Kavach sends periodic status updates to the Network Monitoring System but does not supervise or protect the train. The loco pilot must manually exit IS mode by switching to Service mode and reopening the EM and MR cocks. This mode should only be used under extreme necessity, as the Kavach will not provide any train supervision or protection, placing full responsibility for the train's safety on the loco pilot." }
